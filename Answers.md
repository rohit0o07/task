1A)Based on the provided context, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a relationship defined by the "category_id" column in the "Product" entity. 
Each record in the "Product" table contains a "category_id" which corresponds to a record in the "Product_Category, 
establishing a relationship. 
This is typically a one-to-many relationship, where one category can have many products.

2A)To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you could implement several strategies:
Foreign Key Constraint: You can define a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, referencing the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that every category ID assigned to a product in the "Product" table exists in the "Product_Category" table.
Database Triggers: You can create a trigger on the "Product" table that fires before an insert or update operation. This trigger can check if the new or updated category ID exists in the "Product_Category" table and if not, it can prevent the operation from taking place and return an error.
Application-level Validation: In your application code, you can add a validation step before inserting or updating a product in the "Product" table. This validation can check if the category ID exists in the "Product_Category" table and if not, it can prevent the operation and return an error.
Regular Audits: Regularly audit the data in the "Product" table to ensure that all category IDs exist in the "Product_Category" table. This could be done manually or through automated scripts.
